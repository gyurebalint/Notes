## Projects
[golang_library_api]([gyurebalint/golang_library_api: Small backend api for a library. Could be useful anyone who wants to make a frontend app for practice (github.com)](https://github.com/gyurebalint/golang_library_api))
-   gorilla
-   in memory

Simple backend api for a library to start immersing myself into golang. Nothing fancy, no structuring, no frameworks just one file and basic CRUD.

[golang_bookstore_api]([gyurebalint/golang_bookstore_api (github.com)](https://github.com/gyurebalint/golang_bookstore_api))
-   golang
-   gorilla
-   gorm
-   sqlite

This is the same as [golang_library_api](https://github.com/gyurebalint/golang_library_api) only with structure and a database.
