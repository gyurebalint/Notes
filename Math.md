I'm looking to teach myself advanced math. In what order do you recommend I study?
 
![](https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/img/renderTimingPixel.png)
<details><summary>Reddit post</summary> Starting with AP calculus, okay. That you made it through AP calculus is good: I don't like it because it has too many little trees that obscure the forest. It was by people not confident enough to know what third level material to omit.

The most important topics in a college major in mathematics are, in this order, linear algebra, advanced calculus, and ordinary differential equations.

For each topic, the emphasis can be on getting background (A) to do well with old applications in other fields or (B) for more advanced work in mathematics.

Each topic, with all its candidate content, is huge, far too much for a one year course.

Here we can boil down to essentials:

Linear algebra. Start with a system of m linear equations in n unknowns. Get solutions with elementary row operations as in Gauss elimination. See the possibilities: none, one, or infinitely many solutions.

Applications: Now, in a long afternoon, can do the simplex algorithm of linear programming (optimization). Can now retrace several Nobel prizes in economics. In another hour, can see that when the problem is to find least cost flows on a network where the arc capacities are integers, can get integer linear programming for no extra effort and, at times, have a powerful tool. Can do two person game theory in about 10 minutes.

Move to geometry: Regard the solution of the linear equations as a 'vector' in a vector space and the equations as a linear function. Introduce matrix algebra as an easier way to write and think about the equations. Observe that the linear function can only move a circle into an ellipse and, then, rotate or reflect the ellipse.

Applications: Now have a start on the mathematics for quantum mechanics. Can also do group representation theory (e.g., as used in molecular spectroscopy to identify compounds), a simple version of regression analysis in statistics, discrete Fourier theory, parts of algebraic coding theory, and more.

I would recommend drawing from a stack of books with Halmos's Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces as the most important (most readers should omit the chapter on multi-linear algebra) but NOT the first.

Advanced calculus. Redo calculus but with the proofs. Can do Riemann-Stieltjes integration (not recommended for anyone) instead of just Riemann integration. See the crucial role of the completeness property of the real number system. Learn a lot about continuity and what can and can't do with it. Partial derivatives, the gradient, and the inverse and implicit function theorems.

Applications: Cover convex sets and functions and connect with the best example of a convex function, a quadratic form with a symmetric matrix with no negative eigenvalues. Can do classic Lagrange multipliers, the Kuhn-Tucker conditions in non-linear programming and connect with linear programming, more with Lagrange multipliers, and start on optimal control theory and maybe differential game theory (how a missile chases an airplane). Can trace Debreu's work in economics. Can do more in game theory including Nash's theorem.

Should do classic 3D vector analysis, the 19th century versions of the Gauss, Green, and Stokes theorems (recommended) and modern versions with manifolds and exterior algebra (not generally recommended).

Warning: Don't try to do the Gauss, Green, and Stokes theorems with the full precision of all the rest because these theorems are too difficult. The 19th century versions are not very precise but are EASY, so don't try for much more. Careful treatments are available, but they are in more specialized books or in the journals.

I would recommend drawing from a stack of books, Apostol's first edition (for one of the best treatments of 19th century vector analysis -- he makes it REALLY simple), Buck's Advanced Calculus, Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis (too severe and with too little intuition but standard and should be studied well), Fleming's Functions of Several Variables (clumsy integration theory but one of the nicest treatments of partial derivatives, an important separation theorem, convex functions, and exterior algebra), and more. E.g., you might enjoy Spivak's Calculus on Manifolds -- it's SHORT.

Application: Maxwell's equations.

Ordinary differential equations. Should see how to convert a higher order linear equation to a system of first order equations in several variables (it's easy but helpful). Should see the standard theorems on when a system of linear equations has a unique global solution and when a system of nonlinear equations has a unique local solution. Should see how to solve some common equations, e.g., in A/C circuit theory. Might pursue numerical solutions. Can do boundary value problems with vibrating strings, etc. I recommend Coddington.

Application: Then can do more in deterministic optimal control theory.

On these three, for more, draw from more specialized sources. E.g., for more in Stokes theorem, just go for a book on modern differential geometry or even see what is in the journals.

For more: Set theory, abstract algebra, point set topology, complex variables, partial differential equations of mathematical physics.

For more, do measure theory from Royden's Real Analysis and the first half of Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis. Then do probability from Breiman's Probability. Then for some real dessert, do Luenberger's Optimization by Vector Space Methods. Also, now can attack stochastic processes seriously.

Don't get stuck: Only expect to be able to do about 80% of the exercises because too many of the rest are misplaced and not a good test of your knowledge, with errors (Yes, Virginia), etc. Get explanations from more than one author.

Independent study is from important up to crucial but not sufficient: Mathematics is far too large, and without some knowledgeable guides it is too easy to fail to see the forest for the trees, get off the main track, lost, and stuck, and give up.

In the end what is important is not showing that you can carry this library around in your head but that you can apply it, e.g., to research or to making money.

With Halmos, Rudin's Principles, and Spivak will have essentially covered Harvard's Math 55a as in the colorful

[http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-contents/why-can2019t-a-woman-be-more-like-a-man/?searchterm=Sommers](http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-contents/why-can2019t-a-woman-be-more-like-a-man/?searchterm=Sommers)

If you can cover all this on your own, then Princeton's math department may welcome your application to graduate school. If in addition you have some published papers, maybe just in applications in some silly, trivial field like computer science, the welcome may be even warmer.

Here have touched on many of the top, center crown jewels of civilization -- this is good stuff.

Then a question is, what to do with it? Hmm .... </details>

Math for finance, what do I need?
Calculus: Essential for understanding probability, statistics, and differential equations.  
Linear Algebra: Important for modelling financial data and solving optimization problems.
