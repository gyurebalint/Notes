[Lesson 2 - Introduction to nouns]([Lesson 2 - Introduction to nouns, first declension nouns, cases of nouns - Latin (nationalarchives.gov.uk)](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/latin/stage-1-latin/lessons/lesson-2/))

Nouns are divided into groups called [declensions](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/latin/stage-1-latin/resources/stage-1-glossary-of-english-terms/#declension). Nouns that end in ‘-a’ belong to the **first declension**. They are mostly **feminine**.
In Latin, there are no words for ‘a’ or ‘the’. _Regina_ means:

-   queen
-   the queen
-   a queen

|Latin | English|
|---|---|
|_domina_|lady|
|_ecclesia_|church|
|_parochia_|[parish](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/latin/stage-1-latin/resources/stage-1-glossary-of-english-terms#parish)|
|_terra_|land|
|_vidua_|widow|

|**Singular**|**Meaning**|**Plural**|
|:-------|------|-----|
|_cart**a**_|charter(s) <br> Subject of the sentence: A charter costs 2 pounds.| _cart**e**_|
|_cart**a**_|Oh charter(s)!|_cart**e**_
|_cart**am**_|charter(s) <br> Object of the sentence: The king grants the charter.|_cart**as**_
|_cart**e**_|of the charter(s) <br> The seal of the charter is broken.|_cart**arum**_|
|_cart**e**_|to or for the charter(s)  <br>|They refer to the charters.|_cart**is**_
|_cart**a**_|by, with or from the charter(s) <br>He claims the land by a charter.|_cart**is**_

The ending of a noun is **crucial**, as it tells you
-   whether the noun is singular or plural
-   what role the noun is playing in the sentence

All first declension nouns take the same endings as _carta_ **except**
|Latin|English|
|---|---|
|_anima_|soul|
|_filia_|daughter|

A few first declension nouns are **masculine**. You are only likely to come across these three words:
|Latin|English|
|----|----|
|_agricola_|farmer|
|_papa_|pope|
|_parsona_|[parson](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/latin/stage-1-latin/resources/stage-1-glossary-of-english-terms#parson)|

## Cases of nouns

### 1. Nominative

Used for the **subject** of the verb. The subject is the person or thing doing the verb.For example,
|Latin|English|
|----|----|
|_regina orat_|the queen prays|
The queen is the subject, as she is praying. The queen is in the **nominative** case.

### 2. Vocative

Used to call or **address** someone or something.  
For example
|Latin|English|
|----|----|
|_O domina!_|Oh lady!|
|_O regina!_|Oh queen!|
|_O Maria!_|Oh Mary!|
The vocative case is the same as the nominative, except in the second declension.

### Latin document points

The vocative case is used in chronicles and in the inscriptions on tombs. You will not find it in many other sources.

### 3. Accusative

Used for the **object** of a verb. The object is the person or thing the verb is done to. For example:

|Latin|English|
|----|----|
|_domina cartam confirmat._|The lady confirms the charter.|
‘the lady’ is the subject and in the nominative
‘the charter’ is the object and in the **accusative**

### 4. Genitive

Used for nouns that are ‘**of**’ something else and also to show **possession**.

|Latin|English|
|----|----|
|_terra ecclesie_|The land of the church.|
|_filie vidue_|The widow’s daughters|

### 5. Dative

Used for nouns that are **to** or **for** something. For example:

|Latin|English|
|----|----|
|_terram ecclesie do_ |I give land to the church|
‘I give’ is the verb – _do_. ‘Land’ is the object – it is in the accusative. ‘To the church’ is in the **dative**.

### 6. Ablative

Used for nouns that are **by**, **with** or **from** something.

|Latin|English|
|----|----|
|_papa ecclesiam carta confirmat_ |The pope confirms the church by a charter|
‘The pope’ is the subject – it is in the nominative. ‘Confirms’ is the verb.
‘The church’ is the object – it is in the accusative. ‘By a charter’ is **ablative**.
