Verbs are divided into groups called conjugations. You can recognise first conjugation verbs as they end ‘**-are**’.

|Latin | English|
|--------------|--|
|	_confirmare_ | to confirm|
| _dare_ | to give|
	|_edificare_  | to build|
	|_laborare_ | to work|
	|_legare_ | to leave, [bequeath](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/latin/stage-1-latin/resources/stage-1-glossary-of-english-terms/#bequeath)|
|	_orare_ | to pray|
|	_vocare_ | to call|

To conjugate, or list the parts, of first conjugation verbs
 - Remove the ***are****
 - Add the following endings
|Latin|English|
|:----:|:----------:|
|-o      |  I|
|-as      | you|
|-at      | he/she/it|
|-amus | we|
|-atis   |  you|
|-ant    | they |

|Latin	| Means in English|
|-----|---------|
|do	  |      I give|
|das	 |       you give|
|dat	 |       he/she/it gives|
|damus|	    we give|
|datis|	    you give|
|dant	|        they give|

Did you notice that most of the endings include ‘**a**’? This is called the [key letter](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/latin/stage-1-latin/resources/stage-1-glossary-of-english-terms/#key).
The exception is the form for the first person singular, ‘I’, which ends in ‘-o’.

|Latin	 |   Means in English|
|--|--|
|laboro	 |   I work|
|legas	 |   you bequeath|
|edificat|	he/she/it builds|
|oramus	|We pray|
|vocatis	|    you call|
|legant	 |   they bequeath|
