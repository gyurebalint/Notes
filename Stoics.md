[NEVER discuss these 11 SUBJECTS and be like a STOIC | Stoicism - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6uLLgTBhQ)
# 1 Don't talk about your achievements
- External recognition feeds the ego and vanity
- True achievements isn't the one stopped to be admired but the one that silently transforms the community.
# 2 Don't talk about challenges not overcome
- A relentless  pursuit of external recognition and praise could indeed be a veil that hides our true potential
- Stoics didn't value achievements that could be easily displayed as trophies. They sought true glory in acts that elevated humanity, acts rooted in values like justice generosity and wisdom.
# 3 Don't talk about your good deeds
- True generosity didn't need to be proclaimed in public squares or shouted from the mountaintops. It should in its essence, be a genuine and subtle gesture done out of the simple desire to do good without expecting praise in return.
- If we brag about every altruistic act, we might inadvertently seek the fleeting warmth of applause. 
- Keeping our good deeds under the cloak of anonymity provides us with a sacred moment of reflection and pause, a moment of intimate connection with ourselves where we can question whether our actions were genuine or motivated by other interests.
- This secret self analysis becomes a catalyst for personal improvement.

# 4 Don't talk about your resentment
- The stoics encouraged us to seek the origins of others actions, to understand before we judge.
- Forgiveness then, is not just an altruistic gesture, but an act of profound wisdom that unravels the mysteries of the human soul frees us from the chains of negativity.
- Because anger and resentment are silent poisons, flames that when fed consume our tranquillity and well being.
-  By embracing this lesson we find that at times the greatest strength lies in letting go in freeing ourselves from the chains of the past.
# 5 Don't talk about your deepest dream
- After all who hasn't felt the flame of a dream extinguished prematurely when exposed to the cold of scepticism or the heat of ridicule.
- True accomplishment is not a chalice to be displayed, but an internal well from which one can always draw.
- Choosing silence about our grand goals was not an act of shyness but a deliberate choice. 
- To walk with humility avoiding the pride that sometimes blinds.
- In the end, the stoic legacy speaks to the heart. There is no need to shout our dreams from mountaintops. Instead, protect them, cultivate them, and watch them flourish in their silent majestic glory.
# 6 Don't talk about your next steps

# 7  Don't talk about your doubts and uncertainties
- Picture yourself in a vast forest where each tree represents a doubt and each shadow an uncertainty. Instead of shouting your hesitation to the world, you choose silent introspection, seeking answers within your own soul. This is the path of the stoics at the core of stoic philosophy.
- Confidence isn't a flag to be waved in front of the world, but an inner beacon that guides our way.
- Therefore always choose when and with whom you will share your vulnerabilities.
- Understand the importance of silence and introspection, believe that often the answers to the deepest questions resonate in the quiet chambers of the heart and mind.
- By harbouring certain uncertainties you can cultivate deeper reflection and a more intimate connection with your essence.

# 8 Don't talk about others
- We must be guardians of our words and thoughts. Instead of focusing on the faults of others, let's turn our gaze to our own reflection.
- In a world where criticism is easily launched, stoic teachings inspire us to embrace understanding, acceptance and kindness, casting stones of empathy into the lake of humanity and appreciating the waves of positivity they generate.
# 9 Don't talk about your moments of solitude
 - Stoics didn't shun solitude. They embraced it, in their moments of retreat. They didn1t feel isolated but connected to a rich universe filled with insights. 
 - By moving away from a constant need for exposure, we find a space where our soul can breathe.
 - It is in this deep silence that we discover the melody of our essence. The sound that doesn't need to be shared but only felt in its purity and truth.
# 10 Don't talk about unlearned lessons
- Just as an artist turns their mistake into a crucial part of their work, the Stoics turn their failures into foundations for growth.

# 11 Don't talk about your deepest plans
- Discretion is not a weakness, but a strength. For them, every plan or goal was like a delicate seed that needed to be nurtured with care and protection. By avoiding the premature exposure of these plans, they ensured that they had the ideal environment to grow and flourish away from the storms of doubt, envy or public scrutiny.
- By protecting our deepest plans we allow them to develop at their own pace, free from interference. And by doing so we may discover that true magic lies not in what we declare to the world, but what we quietly achieve in the recesses of our determination.
