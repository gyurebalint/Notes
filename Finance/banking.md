equity:
assets = Liability + Equity
bank:
bank notes: an IOU that a bank gives out stating with it you can withdraw that money from that bank. The standardized version is a dollar.
check: a valid IOU for requesting a deposit from one account to another in a bank
fractional bank reserve: the ratio between the banks reserve to the loan it can lend out.
reserve: A bank reserve is the banks cash/money set aside to satisfy the demand when needed. The reserve ratio defines how much money a bank has to keep to their demand accounts. The bank doesnt get any interest on their reserves, the central bank doesnt give interest on banks reserves. 
leverage: how much assets do you control with a certain amount of equity. Assets / Equity
If a bank gives out bad loans, than their assets amount decrease, their liabilities stay the stay, resulting in	negative leverage, negative equity. Meaning no amount of time (to wait for the loans to be payed back) is
going to solve the problem. This is called INSOLVENCY.
insolvency: negative leverage, negative equity, when no amount of time will help the bank because of bad loans.
illiquidity: when the loans are good, but too many people want to take out their money. With time the bank will function normally


reserve bank (central bank):
Bank-runs affect everyone. 
Every bank has a checking account at the reserve bank. Only central bank issues currency and only one type of currency/bank note. The banks gold is at the reserved bank. If a bank needs to borrow some money because of illiquidity than there is a central place to do that.
Currency bank notes or reserve notes which we know as dollars are issued by the federal banks and banks agreed to use this. This gives the government obligation to pay back whoever holds that bank note its value amount. Government can take this obligations because they could always tax more people to back their money obligations

reserve ratio: reserve to demand deposits ratio cant go under 10%
treasuries: government IOU. Risk free. Gov this way can borrow money from you and give you this IOU (treasury).

base money supply (M0):  federal reserve deposits and notes. the size of the liabilities of the federal reserve.

M1: how much money pple think they have. Its the demand deposit accounts' amount. In case of a bank, this is the right side (liabilities), its peoples' deposit amounts added up

Fractional reserve landing. The central bank has no reserve requirement, cause they can always back their money e.g.: tax more people

How do you increase the money supply? (increase/decrease)
- Decrease the reserve ratio e.g.: from 50% to 10%. Which means banks could increase their number/amount of checking accounts, they would lend out more compared to their reserves than before in and this would increase overall amount of money in circulation
- Increase their reserves, somehow add to their actual reserves. Federal reserves have no fractional reserve requirement so they can increase their assets. 
	- Print some $100 bills and buy treasuries on the open market (buy it from me for example). 
	- Now I don't have a treasury in my hand, I have a 100 dollar and I'll put that money into the bank.
	- This increases the bank reserves which would mean that it can lend more money out increasing the overall money supply

 expanding the money supply will have the effect of increasing the lending power of banks while reaching the target interest rate.

Target rate: This is the rate the Fed wants banks to lend money to each other on a very short term basis overnight. The Fed doesn't set this rate, if it wants to increase the money supply which will increase the banks reserves so that the demand for the banks lending each other goes down therefore the interest rate for lending goes down. This is why its a target rate, it wants it to go down to that level.

 Why make an interest a target price and not the money supply?
 - it's easier to measure, no surveys not data collection, just the rate of lending's of the banks
 Why not just keep the money supply at a constant rate, say 50% of the GDP? 
 - it has to be elastic enough to serve the people with good projects (that benefit society) when they need that money

 gold standard: only thing the gold did was to put a little more confidence behind the bank notes (currency), however its just a precious metal. getting off of it means now the us government guarantees the value, the buying power behind the currency. It is a better guarantee since the government can tax people. Tax is just the price of using the economy.

Federal funds rate: target rate that the fed wants banks lend money to each other. Usually overnight loans.

Discount window: a lender of last resort to the banks. a bank can go to the federal reserve and borrow directly from the fed. Usually when other banks are not willing to lend this bank money (loss of confidence). The bank has to offer some collateral for this loan.
Discount rate: the interest rate with which a bank can get a loan from the fed. Discount rate > federal funds rate

[Federal Reserve - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve)

 repo/repurchase agreement: an agreement that I buy back the collateral I borrowed against. 
 e.g.: a pawn shop transaction. At first, you get money for your pawn object (loan), than at a later date you buy back the object plus interest.

Problem
unstable environment because if there is one bad bank (meaning insolvent = gave out bad loans) that creates in-confidence in the banking system which results in people getting their money out of their banks, which makes good banks illiquid.
How does the Federal reserve differentiates between a good and a bad bank?
Federal reserve = lender of last reserve

bank run: 
- enough for one bad actor (bank) to ruin the whole system
- enough one large withdrawal without a bad actor to ruin the system
Fixes: 
- a lender of last resort - Federal Reserve Bank
- deposit insurance - Federal Deposit Insurance Corp - if our bank goes bust the FED will cover your liabilities. If there are multiple banks and all of them are FDIC proofed equally and all the people leave their money/deposits with the highest interest one then all the money again goes to the highest interest bank and we know high interest in a bank equals high risk taking. 
	- this is a really cheap insurance, encourages risk-taking
If you need the government is it even capitalism?
Banks are just arbitraging the yield curve with cheap insurance.

If you lend money to some entities, such as government, Berkshire-Hathaway for example, for the short term you are going to get less of a return than on long term. Now, banks can borrow very cheaply because they don't even pay interest on this for us and if all else fails they are bailed out with FDIC insurance. they still can invest in these high risk, high return assets such as stock and keep the difference as profits since we are not using only 10% of our money and they can invest the rest. 
Any other mechanism like this can survive without government regulation and involvement, such as private equity firms where you have to lock up your money for some time and know the risk. Or stock, or government bonds or venture capital, but not banks.
