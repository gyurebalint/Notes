Martin Housel - the diary of a CEO
bad news happens fast, good news happens slowly
buying a house for financial reason as in profitting off of it is stupid.
buying it to establish a home base is totally okay
sitting on cash is the name of the game. waiting for the right opportunity in cash to invest in sth
best things are difficult, you have to pay in emotion, attention, focus, stress
