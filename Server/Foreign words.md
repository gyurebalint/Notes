PCIe slot: used for extension. lets you plug in peripherals such as graphics card, NVMe s, network card etc

NVMe: NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) is a new storage access and transport protocol for flash and next-generation solid-state drives (SSDs) that delivers the highest throughput and fastest response times yet for all types of enterprise workloads.
Today, in both consumer apps and business, users expect ever-faster response times, even as the applications themselves become vastly more complex and resource dependent.
To help deliver a high-bandwidth, low-latency user experience, the NVMe protocol accesses flash storage via a PCI Express (PCIe) bus, which supports tens of thousands of parallel command queues and thus is much faster than hard disks and traditional all-flash architectures, which are limited to a single command queue.
The NVMe specification takes advantage of nonvolatile memory in all kinds of computing environments. And itâ€™s future-proof, extendable to work with not-yet-invented persistent memory technologies.
