PCIe slot: used for extension. lets you plug in peripherals such as graphics card, NVMe s, network card etc

NVMe: NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) is a new storage access and transport protocol for flash and next-generation solid-state drives (SSDs) that delivers the highest throughput and fastest response times yet for all types of enterprise workloads.
Today, in both consumer apps and business, users expect ever-faster response times, even as the applications themselves become vastly more complex and resource dependent.
To help deliver a high-bandwidth, low-latency user experience, the NVMe protocol accesses flash storage via a PCI Express (PCIe) bus, which supports tens of thousands of parallel command queues and thus is much faster than hard disks and traditional all-flash architectures, which are limited to a single command queue.
The NVMe specification takes advantage of nonvolatile memory in all kinds of computing environments. And itâ€™s future-proof, extendable to work with not-yet-invented persistent memory technologies.

# share repurchase program
Share repurchase programs, also known as stock buybacks, are initiatives by companies to buy back their own shares from the marketplace. This process reduces the number of outstanding shares available to the public, which can have several implications for the company and its shareholders. Here are the key points about share repurchase programs:

1. **Increase in Share Price**: By reducing the supply of shares, buybacks can increase the earnings per share (EPS) and potentially the stock price, assuming demand remains constant or increases.
    
2. **Return of Capital to Shareholders**: Share repurchases are a way for companies to return capital to shareholders. Unlike dividends, which provide a regular income stream, buybacks offer shareholders the option to sell their shares back to the company.
    
3. **Signal of Confidence**: A share repurchase can signal to the market that the company's management believes its shares are undervalued, suggesting confidence in the company's future performance.
    
4. **Improved Financial Ratios**: Buybacks can improve financial ratios such as EPS and return on equity (ROE) by reducing the number of shares outstanding and the equity base, respectively.
    
5. **Tax Efficiency**: In some jurisdictions, share buybacks can be more tax-efficient than dividends. Shareholders who sell their shares back to the company may benefit from capital gains tax rates, which can be lower than the tax rates on dividends.
    
6. **Flexibility**: Share repurchase programs offer more flexibility compared to dividends. Companies can buy back shares opportunistically based on market conditions and their cash position.
    
7. **Control Over Ownership**: Buybacks can be used to thwart takeover attempts by reducing the number of shares available in the market, thereby making it more difficult for an entity to acquire a controlling stake.
    
8. **Potential for Manipulation**: Critics argue that buybacks can be used to artificially inflate stock prices and boost executive compensation tied to stock performance, without necessarily improving the company's underlying fundamentals.
    
9. **Impact on Cash Reserves**: Repurchasing shares requires cash, which could otherwise be used for investment in growth opportunities, paying down debt, or other strategic initiatives.
    

Overall, while share repurchase programs can benefit shareholders and signal positive management confidence, they need to be evaluated within the context of the company's overall strategy, financial health, and market conditions.
