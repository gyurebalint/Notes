Energy efficient setup
Don't buy anything older than intel 4th gen cpu 
idle watts matter
use 6th or 7th gen cpu
intel vs amd: intel is more budget
dont pay more for T type cpu s for power savings
idle power matters the most, not a lot of website publicate this.
[one website that does](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/)

MiniTx is more efficient (one PCIe slot)
- Fujitsu D3417-B11 (MATX)
- Gigabyte C246N-WU2
- MSI Z1701 Gaming pro ac
- asrock H510M-HVS r2.0
- asrock H410M-HVS r2.0
- ASROCK B85M-ITX
- ASUS H110-plus
Fujitsu is good, power efficient.

Motherboard
has to be intel compatible with an integrated graphics card. Have to check whether that graphics card supports transcoding
check for a hd grapics 630 processor (buy it used) and see what kind of motherboard do I need.
