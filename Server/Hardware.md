Energy efficient setup
Don't buy anything older than intel 4th gen cpu 
idle watts matter
use 6th or 7th gen cpu
intel vs amd: intel is more budget
dont pay more for T type cpu s for power savings
idle power matters the most, not a lot of website publicate this.
[one website that does](https://www.hardwareluxx.de/)

MiniTx is more efficient (one PCIe slot)
- Fujitsu D3417-B11 (MATX)
- Gigabyte C246N-WU2
- MSI Z1701 Gaming pro ac
- asrock H510M-HVS r2.0
- asrock H410M-HVS r2.0
- ASROCK B85M-ITX
- ASUS H110-plus
Fujitsu is good, power efficient.
lower loads power supply is not efficient, so for this use PicoPSU is your idle is lower than 50W and load power is no more than 200W
Hard drive: 5400 and 722 rpm drives. latter is faster. 5400 is cooler and quieter. choose this one. Spinning down a drive could save more watts.
tiered caching can make your rig faster. in UNRAID  you can set this up.

the processesor has to have this.
Zima board has Intel processor, so this could be used for media server and another separate machine as a NAS.

Motherboard
has to be intel compatible with an integrated graphics card. Have to check whether that graphics card supports transcoding
check for a hd grapics 630 processor (buy it used) and see what kind of motherboard do I need.

"J4105 has an intel 600 series igpu. It supports 4k hevc transcoding. I am sure it can do 3 1080p h264 transcodes on the fly. I used the j3455 cpu and i could do 2 1080p transcodes on the fly. Go with it, it is a great motherboard. I had to let it go because i wanted to have a vm with router, requireing 2 nics."

Hey Markus, I am thinking about creating a home server for me and my family. I want to have a large filestorage so we wont have to pay for 3rd party cloud storage, also I want to run a multi media server on it to.
I looked into a lot of stuff already but I want to pick your brain about the subject.
do you have a couple of minutes to talk about sth like this, maybe even in internal huddle?
